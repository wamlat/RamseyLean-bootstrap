# Optimizing the CGMS upper bound on Ramsey numbers in Lean

This repository contains a Lean 4 + Mathlib formalization of Theorem 1 and
Corollary 6 of Parth Gupta, Ndiamé Ndiaye, Sergey Norin, and Louis Wei,
[*Optimizing the CGMS upper bound on Ramsey
numbers*](paper/main.pdf). The bundled PDF is the source for all statement
wording and numbering below.

## The statements being formalized

The Ramsey number `R(k, ℓ)` is the least `N` such that every red-blue coloring
of the complete graph on `N` vertices contains either a red `K_k` or a blue
`K_ℓ`. The development represents a coloring by its red graph, with blue edges
given by the complement:

```lean
def RamseyBound (k ℓ N : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ G : SimpleGraph (Fin N),
    hasRedClique G Finset.univ k ∨ hasBlueClique G Finset.univ ℓ

noncomputable def ramseyNumber (k ℓ : ℕ) : ℕ := by
  classical
  exact Nat.find (exists_ramseyBound k ℓ)

def ramseyLinearScale (k : ℕ) : ℝ := k

def SublinearError (η : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop :=
  η =o[atTop] ramseyLinearScale
```

Thus `SublinearError η` says that `η(k) = o(k)` as `k → ∞`.

### Theorem 1

For all positive integers `ℓ ≤ k`,

$$
R(k,\ell) \leq
\exp\!\left(G(\ell/k)k+o(k)\right)\binom{k+\ell}{\ell},
\qquad
G(\lambda)=\left(-\frac14\lambda+\frac{3}{100}\lambda^2
+\frac{2}{25}\lambda^3\right)e^{-\lambda}.
$$

The Lean theorem makes the uniform meaning of `o(k)` explicit: a single error
function `η`, independent of `ℓ`, works simultaneously for every positive
`ℓ ≤ k`.

```lean
theorem main :
    ∃ η : ℕ → ℝ,
      SublinearError η ∧
      ∀ k ℓ : ℕ, 0 < ℓ → ℓ ≤ k →
        (ramseyNumber k ℓ : ℝ) ≤
          Real.exp
              (((-(1 / 4 : ℝ) * ((ℓ : ℝ) / (k : ℝ)) +
                    (3 / 100 : ℝ) * ((ℓ : ℝ) / (k : ℝ)) ^ 2 +
                    (2 / 25 : ℝ) * ((ℓ : ℝ) / (k : ℝ)) ^ 3) *
                  Real.exp (-((ℓ : ℝ) / (k : ℝ)))) *
                (k : ℝ) + η k) *
            (Nat.choose (k + ℓ) ℓ : ℝ)
```

The decimal coefficients in the paper are represented by the exact rational
numbers `1/4`, `3/100`, and `2/25`.

### Corollary 6

For all positive integers `ℓ ≤ k`,

$$
R(k,\ell) \leq
4(k+\ell)
\left(\frac{(\sqrt5+1)(k+2\ell)}{4\ell}\right)^\ell
\left(\frac{k+2\ell}{k}\right)^{k/2}.
$$

Its printed statement is exposed directly as follows:

```lean
theorem ramseyNumber_le_easy_optimized {k ℓ : ℕ}
    (hℓ : 0 < ℓ) (hℓk : ℓ ≤ k) :
    (ramseyNumber k ℓ : ℝ) ≤
      4 * ((k : ℝ) + (ℓ : ℝ)) *
        (((Real.sqrt 5 + 1) * ((k : ℝ) + 2 * (ℓ : ℝ))) /
          (4 * (ℓ : ℝ))) ^ ℓ *
        (((k : ℝ) + 2 * (ℓ : ℝ)) / (k : ℝ)) ^ ((k : ℝ) / 2)
```

The power indexed by `ℓ` is a natural power. The final power is `Real.rpow`,
as required by the real exponent `k/2`, including when `k` is odd.

## Structure of the proof

1. **Finite graph foundations.** Ramsey bounds are defined using a graph and
   its complement, and the usual recurrence and finite counting identities
   are proved.
2. **The elementary excess argument.** Candidate and excess inequalities are
   combined with a deterministic weighted bipartition argument to prove
   Corollary 6.
3. **Book induction.** Generalized binomial estimates, blue-book extraction,
   degree regularization, and uniform asymptotic bounds provide the main
   book-induction result.
4. **Descent and the frontier.** Dense and sparse cases are assembled into a
   uniform descent theorem, and a concave frontier construction feeds stronger
   Ramsey bounds into a second descent.
5. **Certified numerical optimization.** Independently selected parameters and
   kernel-checked interval certificates establish the exponential correction
   in Theorem 1.
6. **Final assembly.** A uniform one-sided Stirling estimate converts the
   exponential entropy bound into the binomial form stated in Theorem 1.

The intermediate results from the manuscript are sometimes strengthened,
generalized, or replaced by sufficient statements better suited to Lean; see
[`FORMALIZATION.md`](FORMALIZATION.md) for the paper-to-Lean map.

## Certified numerical optimization

The numerical optimization was redone independently for this formalization.
The manuscript's Mathematica-assisted certificate is not imported as proof
evidence. Instead, the development proves soundness theorems for fixed-point
interval arithmetic, Taylor enclosures, and outward rounding. Certificate
endpoints and checker decisions are exact integers; floating-point sampling
was used only to choose parameters and meshes. Every inequality used to reach
Theorem 1 is ultimately checked by Lean's kernel.

## Scope

The repository formalizes Theorem 1 and Corollary 6 together with the results
needed for their proofs. Remark 17, including its preliminary unverified
further optimization, and Section 5 (Observation 18 through Remark 22) are
intentionally outside scope.

## Building

The project pins Lean and Mathlib to `v4.32.1`. After installing
[Elan](https://lean-lang.org/install/) and Git, run from the repository root:

```text
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

The root target checks the complete formalization, including the concrete
numerical certificates. No external numerical program or untrusted generated
output is needed during the build.

## Verification

The full `lake build` succeeds. The Lean source contains no `sorry`, `admit`,
or user-declared placeholder axioms. For both `RamseyLean.main` and
`RamseyLean.ramseyNumber_le_easy_optimized`, `#print axioms` reports only
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.

The latest clean Ubuntu 24.04 validation completed successfully on August 17,
2026: all 3,995 Lake jobs succeeded in 5 h 28 min of wall-clock time. The
[GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/snorin239/RamseyLean/actions/runs/31980959440)
records the complete build.
